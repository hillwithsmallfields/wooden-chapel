# wooden-chapel

A design for a simple chapel made of timber, with some inspiration from the Norwegian stavkirker.

The house I currently rent came with a wooden summerhouse, which I've been using as my prayer place.  It's now falling apart, and the landlord won't replace it but says that I can put one of my own in its place.

I looked at getting a ready-made summerhouse, but the suppliers are shut down for the coronavirus, so I decided to design and make my own purpose-built prayer place.

It gets a little inspiration from the wooden churches in Norway, but doesn't try to be the same as them, and will have some ideas that just make intuitive engineering sense to me.

It's designed so it can be taken apart and moved (as I'm only renting this house); and also so it can be put together and taken apart by one person, from the ground or with a stool or at most a stepladder to stand on.
